<p>Dear Rosie,</p>
<p>Happy one year anniversary! It feels like a dream to be able to say that to you. It wasn’t that long ago when we were lamenting to one another night after night how perfect it would be if only we could be together. How nice it would be to have each other in one another’s lives. How picturesque our lives together could be. I’m happy to say that as of 365 days, that no longer is a fantasy. Being able to call you mine is my greatest joy in life, and I endeavor to spend that life building a future for us to enjoy forever. Through thick and thin I vow to stay eternally by your side, always being your number one cheerleader, your most trusted confidant, and your best friend. You understand me more than anything or anyone in this universe, and for that, the least I can do is devote my heart, mind, body, and soul to making sure you feel loved for all of time.</p>
<p>Falling in love with you was quite possibly the easiest thing I’ve ever done. I swear I couldn’t help it. I know my history, trust me, but with you it was simply… inevitable. Where do I even begin? Your beaming smile? Your impossible-to-ignore cadence? Your infectious passion? Those bright, hopeful eyes that almost make me believe in a god? Any number of those things in their lonesome have swayed greater men than me, but I’m the lucky bastard that gets to see it all up close and personal. What an honor. I can’t fathom what I’ve done to deserve this angel but like hell am I taking you back to the shop. I’m holding onto you ‘til I can’t hold anything anymore, and even then I’ll come find you after it all. The greatest thing about being with you is finding even more things that make me fall in love with you over and over again. Your fierce loyalty to your friends, your dogged dedication to your work, and your undying affection for your family (even if they do annoy you sometimes). But the thing that makes me fall in love with you deeper and deeper and deeper every single day, the thing that makes me feel like the luckiest person in the entire universe, is your vulnerability with me. The way we’ve grown close, that makes us comfortable enough to share our deepest and darkest thoughts with one another. Those quiet times at night when we’re almost asleep, and your tiny voice whispering in my ear whatever thought might be passing by, be it trivial or universal. The bond of trust we established that fateful night you confided in me, and every other wall we’ve broken in between us since, I wouldn’t trade that for the world. It couldn’t be with anyone else but you. I couldn’t be with anyone else but you.</p>
<p>So as we look to the future, there’s still many unknowns in our path. But honestly, that just makes me more excited to explore the possibilities with you. Where we might live, what we might do for work, if we’re having kids, how many kids, investment portfolios, joint bank accounts, laundry, taxes. It’s so daunting in isolation, like soul-crushingly monumental in its scope. But when I think about it with you by my side, I almost can’t wait to tackle it as team. I’ll always be your best teammate there is, and I promise to always play for keeps when it comes to us and our family. You’ll forever be my number one priority, and I hope I can always remind you of that every single day. At the end of the day, I say with no hesitation or pause, I love you with all my heart. You make me want to live to tomorrow, to build a brighter future not just for you, but for myself. You’re my brightest guiding star, and I never want to stop basking in the glow of you. I love you Rose Leung. It’s an honor to be loved by you.</p>
<p>Forever yours,</p>
<p>Enrique</p>

			<h1 class="text-xl">Happy Anniversary Rose!</h1><br />
			<p>Dear Rose,</p><br />
			<p>
				Happy one year anniversary! It feels like a
				dream to be able to say that to you. It wasn't
				that long ago when we were lamenting to one
				another night after night how perfect it would
				be if only we could be together. How nice it
				would be to have each other in one another's
				lives. How picturesque our lives could be. I'm
				happy to say after 365 days, that no longer is a
				fantasy. Being able to call you mine is the
				greatest joy in life, and I endeavor to spend
				that life building a future for us to enjoy
				forever. Through thick and thin I vow to stay
				eternally by your side, always being your number
				one cheerleader, your most trusted confidant,
				and your best friend. You understand me more
				than anything or anyone in this universe, and
				for that, the least I can do is devote my heart,
				mind, body, and soul to making sure you feel
				loved for all of time.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				Falling in love with you was quite possibly the
				easiest thing I've ever done. I swear I couldn't
				help it. I know my history, trust me, but with
				you it was simply... inevitable. Where do I even
				begin? Your beaming smile? Your
				impossible-to-ignore cadence? Your infectious
				passion? Those bright, hopeful eyes that almost
				make me believe in a god? Any number of those
				things in their lonesome have swayed greater men
				than me, but I'm the lucky bastard that gets to
				see it all up close and personal. What an honor.
				I can't fathom what I've done to deserve this
				angel but like hell am I taking you back to the
				shop. I'm holding on to you 'til I can't hold
				anything anymore, and even then I'll come find
				you after it all. The greatest thing about being
				with you is finding even more things that make
				me fall in love with you over and over again.
				Your fierce loyalty to your friends, your dogged
				dedication to your work, and your undying
				affection for your family (even if they do annoy
				you sometimes.) But the thing that makes me fall
				in love with you deeper and deeper and deeper
				every single day, the thing that makes me feel
				like the luckiest person in the entire universe,
				is your vulnerability with me. The way we've
				grown close, that makes us comfortable enough to
				share our deepest and darkest thoughts with one
				another. Those quiet times at night when we're
				almost asleep, your tiny voice whispering
				whatever though might be passing by. The bond of
				trust we established that fateful night you
				confided in me, and every other wall we've
				broken in between us since, I wouldn't trade
				that for the world. It couldn't be with anyone
				else but you. I couldn't be with anyone else but
				you.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				So as we look to the future, there's still many
				unknowns in our path. But honestly, that just
				makes me more excited to explore the
				possibilities with you. Where we might live,
				what we might do for work, if we're having kids,
				how many kids, investment portfolios, joint bank
				accounts, laundry, taxes. It's so daunting in
				isolation, monumental in its scope. But when I
				think about it with you by my side, I almost
				can't wait to tackle whatever comes at us. I'll
				always be your best teammate, and I promise to
				always play for keeps when it comes to us and
				our family. You'll forever be my number one
				priority, and I hope I can always remind you of
				that every single day. All things said and done,
				I say with no hesitation or pause, I love you
				with all my heart. You make me want to live to
				tomorrow, to build a brighter future not just
				for your sake, but for once mine as well. You're
				my brightest guiding star, and I never want to
				stop basking in the glow of you.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				I love you, Rose Leung. It's an honor to be
				loved by you.
			</p><br />
			<p>Forever yours,</p>
			<p>Enrique</p>
